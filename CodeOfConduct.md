## Build Trust and Credibility

The success of our business is dependent on the trust and confidence we earn from our employees, customers and shareholders. We gain credibility by adhering to our commitments, displaying honesty and integrity and reaching company goals solely through honorable conduct. It is easy to say what we must do, but the proof is in our actions. Ultimately, we will be judged on what we do.

When considering any action, it is wise to ask: Will this build trust and credibility for Lab6Company<sup>TM</sup>
? Will it help create a working environment in which Lab6Co can succeed over the long term? Is the commitment I am making one I can follow through with? The only way we will maximize trust and credibility is by answering “yes” to those questions and by working every day to build our trust and credibility.

Respect for the Individual

We all deserve to work in an environment where we are treated with dignity and respect. Lab6Company<sup>TM</sup> is committed to creating such an environment because it brings out the full potential in each of us, which, in turn, contributes directly to our business success. We cannot afford to let anyone’s talents go to waste.

Lab6Company<sup>TM</sup> is an equal employment/affirmative action employer and is committed to providing a workplace that is free of discrimination of all types and from abusive, offensive or harassing behavior. Any employee who feels harassed or discriminated against should report the incident to his or her manager or to human resources.

Create a Culture of Open and Honest Communication

At Lab6Company<sup>TM</sup> everyone should feel comfortable to speak his or her mind, particularly with respect to ethics concerns. Managers have a responsibility to create an open and supportive environment where employees feel comfortable raising such questions. We all benefit tremendously when employees exercise their power to prevent mistakes or wrongdoing by asking the right questions at the right times.

Lab6Company<sup>TM</sup> will investigate all reported instances of questionable or unethical behavior. In every instance where improper behavior is found to have occurred, the company will take appropriate action. We will not tolerate retaliation against employees who raise genuine ethics concerns in good faith.

For your information, Lab6Company<sup>TM</sup>’s whistleblower policy is as follows:

Employees are encouraged, in the first instance, to address such issues with their managers or the HR manager, as most problems can be resolved swiftly. If for any reason that is not possible or if an employee is not comfortable raising the issue with his or her manager or HR, [Company Name]’s [Title of Executive Officer] does operate with an open-door policy.

Set Tone at the Top

Management has the added responsibility for demonstrating, through their actions, the importance of this Code. In any business, ethical behavior does not simply happen; it is the product of clear and direct communication of behavioral expectations, modeled from the top and demonstrated by example. Again, ultimately, our actions are what matters.

To make our Code work, managers must be responsible for promptly addressing ethical questions or concerns raised by employees and for taking the appropriate steps to deal with such issues. Managers should not consider employees’ ethics concerns as threats or challenges to their authority, but rather as another encouraged form of business communication. At Lab6Company<sup>TM</sup>, we want the ethics dialogue to become a natural part of daily work.

Uphold the Law

Lab6Company<sup>TM</sup>’s commitment to integrity begins with complying with laws, rules and regulations where we do business. Further, each of us must have an understanding of the company policies, laws, rules and regulations that apply to our specific roles. If we are unsure of whether a contemplated action is permitted by law or [Company Name] policy, we should seek the advice from the resource expert. We are responsible for preventing violations of law and for speaking up if we see possible violations.

Because of the nature of our business, some legal requirements warrant specific mention here. 

Competition

We are dedicated to ethical, fair and vigorous competition. We will sell Lab6Company<sup>TM</sup>products and services based on their merit, superior quality, functionality and competitive pricing. We will make independent pricing and marketing decisions and will not improperly cooperate or coordinate our activities with our competitors. We will not offer or solicit improper payments or gratuities in connection with the purchase of goods or services for [Company Name] or the sales of its products or services, nor will we engage or assist in unlawful boycotts of particular customers.

Proprietary Information

It is important that we respect the property rights of others. We will not acquire or seek to acquire improper means of a competitor’s trade secrets or other proprietary or confidential information. We will not engage in unauthorized use, copying, distribution or alteration of software or other intellectual property.

Selective Disclosure

We will not selectively disclose (whether in one-on-one or small discussions, meetings, presentations, proposals or otherwise) any material nonpublic information with respect to [Company Name], its securities, business operations, plans, financial condition, results of operations or any development plan. We should be particularly vigilant when making presentations or proposals to customers to ensure that our presentations do not contain material nonpublic information.

Health and Safety

Lab6Company<sup>TM</sup> is dedicated to maintaining a healthy environment. A safety manual has been designed to educate you on safety in the workplace. If you do not have a copy of this manual, please see the HR department.

Avoid Conflicts of Interest

Conflicts of Interest

We must avoid any relationship or activity that might impair, or even appear to impair, our ability to make objective and fair decisions when performing our jobs. At times, we may be faced with situations where the business actions we take on behalf of Lab6Company<sup>TM</sup> may conflict with our own personal or family interests. We owe a duty to Lab6Company<sup>TM</sup> to advance its legitimate interests when the opportunity to do so arises. We must never use [Company Name] property or information for personal gain or personally take for ourselves any opportunity that is discovered through our position with Lab6Company<sup>TM</sup>.
